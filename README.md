It’s always cool to think about what the future holds, and Web 3.0 is an exciting one. We are on what feels like the cusp of a new leap in how to use and interact with the web. 
Hence, this is a consequence of the many changes we see happening around us. The leap to Web 2.0 was prompted by a shift towards content that prioritized being servable on a mobile device given the invention of things like the iPhone in the early 2000s. 
What’s more, it also valued social networks like Facebook and Twitter as well as cloud-oriented services such as AWS or Azure. However, what’s exciting is seeing how popular technologies are not just coming to the forefront, but are also becoming key features in the type of content we find on the Web and how we digest it. 
Edge computing, decentralized data networks, and artificial intelligence coming together to create an Open, Trustless, and Permissionless internet sounds exciting, to say the least, so I can’t wait to see what the future holds!

This article written by Max Mersch and Richar Muihead, is very reminiscent of our last lecture about web architecture. It speaks about how the web evolved and key points of its journey such as the innovationof mobile internet, social networks and the cloud. The article also speaks to the security aspect of the web where networks are open, trustless, and permissionless. Apart from the many bolded key terms from this article, I think that it's a great resource of showing what the future may hold with strides in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
